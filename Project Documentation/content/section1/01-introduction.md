## Introduction

### Purpose

Mainly, the purpose of this website is to serve as a portfolio for Jeddeius Matthew J. Tolentino, creator of the website and an aspiring developer and engineer. However these are the following further purpose of this website

1. Professional Portfolio
2. Blog Post
3. Friend Group Website (Personal)
4. Project Holder and Demonstration

Note that as the website becomes more sophisticated, the purpose of the website will grow larger

### Pre-requisite (for developers)

While the documentation will help developers in adapting and getting used to the codebase, background knowledge would be of great importance. The knowledge required at minimum are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The tools and framework that is used for this project will be explained in details as well as how the website uses the tools and how the tools interact with the website and to the other tools.

### Audience

For the meantime, the target audience of the Website would be close relatives, colleagues, and friends however, the actual audience of this website would be the following: employers; investors; and professionals alike.

### Background

Jeddeius' Personal Website was been once attemped to be built and for a beginner's standpoint, it has come far. Unfortunately, due to personal problems, the project was delayed and then completely abandoned. Without documentation, it is hard for the creator himself to even get back and know the framework of the website and the philosophy behind it. For the lead developer, the project is undecipherable.

With proper documentation, the project would not only be understandable and sharable to other developers but the project would ultimately be maintainable.

**Making a good portfolio** to demonstrate skills and knowledge in various fields including but not limited to Mathematics, Physics, General Science, Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Both Macro and Micro skills and knowledge would also be specified to attract more attention. The portfolio would resemble a resume and a Curriculum Vitae. Extracurricular activities, past organizations, experiences, reputation, and person to refer to would also be elaborated in the website.

**Blog post** would also be featured to get in touch and share experience with the community as well as to gain authenticity.

**Friend Group Website** would be the most personal of all. It will also be included as one of the projects I made besides other and the portfolio itself.

**Projects** that needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be directly inputed to the website  If the project is larger that it should be, it would have its own repository with its own documentation.

### Scope and Delimitations

This project assumes that you have atleast, fundamental knowledge of Web Development in order to understand the structure of the website. Because of such assumption, this decumentation would not cover the basics of Web Development but rather cover the tools used used in developing and how the project is organized in the form of both text, outline, and web diagram. Furthermore, all pages of documentation will feature a TL:DR at the bottom of the page.

### Document Organization

The document is structuted so that learning and adapting to the codebase would be easier. It would follow a textbook like flow, startung from the pre-requisite, introduction or the fundamentals to know, to the tools used to build the app, up to the slow buildup or being familiarized ang getting used to the enbironment and workflow of the project.
