# A tour for this Website

## What is this all about?
**It's about showcasing skills and impressing employers**

## The Website
The website has different parts, and in this tutorial, we'll be taking a tour on how things works here

### Documentation
The documentation is important as it allows us to communicate with both developers and other audience. We could keep track of the function of different parts of the website, make generalization, keep track of bug errors and what to fix and what's been fix and what needs revision. Because of such, the documentation is divided into 2 section, **General Documentation** and **Historical Documentation**

#### General Documenatation

### Basic Philosophy of the Website

When you read our website, there are different parts you notice. Assuming that you have at least basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, it is unnecessary to detail it from ground up

All html would consist of Head and Body. The head would feature the following parts: Basic information about the website; SEO syntax about the website; additionalPlugins. *Basic information about the website* would contain the parameters title of the website, the date it was published, and the author. *SEO syntax about the website* would contain machine readable data about the html, it is generated after the website is finalized. *AdditionalPlugins* would contain the standard structure of all html file in this website, change it with caution as it can go bad in many ways.

The body will consist of 3 divisions: **header**, which should always contain *The logo and the setting button* for identity, uniformity, and consistency of the website. *Title of the page* displays the title of the page in a very big font. *Author* and *date* are self explanatory, with the date being the publishing date; **Main**, which contain the main content of the page, is divided into sections, sections are made to divide subjects related to the main topic for clarity and organization, its parameter *id* serves for the main purpose of being refered in the *outline* which is put before the main content to jump from various sections. A section (as of version 0.1) contain paragraph, image, and codeblock (see more details here); footer, which is uniform and consistent throughout the website, contains the following: The Logo (2); Creative Commons; Contact and Information; Terms and Condition
